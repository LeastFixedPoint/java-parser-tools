#summary Format of the recognizable BNF strings.
#labels Featured

A BNF string has the following format:

{{{
name1 ::= (expression1)
name2 ::= (expression2)
...
}}}

It is not required that every definition starts from a new line, we can separate them just by whitespace:

{{{
name1 ::= (expression1) name2 ::= (expression2) ...
}}}

An expression may contain following elements:

|| `(a b c)` || Expressions a, then b, then c in this order. ||
|| `(a|b|c)` || One of the expressions a, b and c. ||
|| `{a b c}` || Sequence of a, then b, then c, repeated any number of times (maybe zero). ||
|| `{a|b|c}` || Sequence of any number of a's, b's and c's in any order. ||
|| `[a b c]` || Either a, then b, then c, or nothing at all. ||
|| `[a|b|c]` || Either a, or b, or c, or nothing at all. ||
|| `"text"` || This exact text.  Double quotes in the text may be escaped with single quotes.  For example "'"this text begins and ends with a double quote'"". ||
|| `%lower%` || Lower case letter. ||
|| `%upper%` || Upper case letter. ||
|| `%alpha%` || Any case letter. ||
|| `%digit%` || A digit (0 to 9). ||
|| `%whitespace%` || Any sequence of ' ' or '\n' or '\r' or '\t' ||
